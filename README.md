Full-Stack Data Engineering Portfolio

Engineered a multi-page, full-stack portfolio application to showcase a range of data-driven projects.

The application features a Streamlit front end and a Python backend, with a PostgreSQL database hosted on a cloud provider (Supabase) for persistent storage.

Leveraged key libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, LangChain for AI-driven functionality, and SQLAlchemy for efficient database interaction.
